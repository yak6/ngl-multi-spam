# ngl-spammer
ngl-spammer got some lines of code from [this script](https://github.com/0MeMo07/NGL-Spammer/blob/main/NGLSpamer.py). 
My modification of this spammer uses the threading library, which allows you to send several messages at once, making it hella fast.
Don't forget to leave a star if u enjoyed this modification.
# Requirements
